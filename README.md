# üçÄ Description

Have you always wanted to grow your own vegetables and fruits, and could really use some help planning your lands? Among others, this app helps on on that.

You can now draw your land and plan it through a user-friendly interface. You can decide where to plant what and when you actually plant you veggies and fruits. If you warn the app when you harvest them, you'll know what your average growth time for this veggie was.

The app gives you standard info on the veggies, and, upon signing in, allows you access to info like the average time of growth for each vegetable for the app users, your own personal average time of growth for your veggies and where do you have this item planted.

A calendar is displayed to help predict when is the time to start thinking about harvesting.
